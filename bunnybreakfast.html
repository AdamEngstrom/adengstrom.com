					<h2>Bunny<wbr>Breakfast.org</h2>
					<h3>The Problem</h3>
						<p>The University of Wisconsin Extension was hosting the first of an annual promotion event for 4-H and wanted to increase the outreach of the event by creating a website.</p>
					<h3>The Users</h3>
						<p>The ideal users were Ozaukee County residents with little or no exposure to 4-H or the Univeristy of Wisconsin Extension.</p>
					<h3>The Process</h3>
						<p>First, I created a basic website using the Bootstrap framework filled out with HTML and CSS.  I did my best to promote good user experience principles; however, the event committee imposed some restrictions that negatively impacted the overall experience such as having two PayPal buttons for each age range which forced the user to go through the ticket buying process twice if they wanted to bring their family with them.</p>
						<p>The overall website, however, turned out well for the short time frame it was made in, and the source files can be found in <a href="https://github.com/AdamEngstrom/BunnyBreakfast" target="_self">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>
						<p>After making the website, I created a Twitter account for the event and would post promotional materials before the event.  During the event, I took pictures and posted them to the account.  The website had a Twitter feed that displayed all of the Tweets in real time as I posted them.  Hopefully, next year I will be able to engage with the attendees more on Twitter to create a more vibrant experience.  Below is a screenshot of some of the @BunnyBreakfast posts I created.</p>

						<p>After the first run of the Bunny Breakfast, I started working on the website for the next year with an aim to improve the overall user experience.  Below is a wireframe I created for the second itteration of the website for the 2016 Bunny Breakfast.
						<div><img src="img/BunnyBreakfast2016.png" alt="Wireframe of the 2016 Bunny Breakfast website."></div> 
					<h3>The Results</h3>
						<p>Thanks to the website that I designed and developed, the event quickly sold out.  Overall, 575 people visited the website and 173 people bought tickets online netting the Extension almost $1,200.00.  The event was such a success that the Extension is considering moving to a larger venue next year.</p>
						<p>The current version of the website can be found at <a href="http://www.bunnybreakfast.org" target="_self">www.BunnyBreakfast.org</a>.</p>
